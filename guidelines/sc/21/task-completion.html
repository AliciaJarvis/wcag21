   <p>Successfully completing tasks does not rely on users memorizing information presented in the current, or previous, user-interaction dialog steps.</p>
<p>Exception: This success criterion does not apply if memorizing, or otherwise mentally processing information, is the primary purpose of the dialog step (e.g., a step in a game which deliberately tests the player's memory skills).</p>
